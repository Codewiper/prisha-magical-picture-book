It, and all the other trees, shimmered with a color she'd never seen – a swirling mix of silver and colors that shifted like oil on water, as if someone had painted them with melted rainbows."

    text: "A bizarre, sweet smell, unlike anything from Mom's baking or Dad's grill, hung heavy in the air. It was a mix of something like cotton candy and honey, but with a faint, almost electric buzz to it that made Prisha's nose tingle and her brain feel a little fuzzy."
